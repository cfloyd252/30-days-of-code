// Objective
// In this challenge, you'll work with arithmetic operators. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

// Task
// Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), 
// and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost.

// Note: Be sure to use precise values for your calculations, or you may end up with an incorrectly rounded result!
